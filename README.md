# LAB: Bring ServiceNow to life in your iOS app! A beginner's guide to the Mobile SDK
This lab was created for and presented at ServiceNow CreatorCon 2024 in Las Vegas. Following that it was published to ServiceNow University, as is typical with CreatorCon labs. However, with the running of Knowledge 2025 it has recently been retired from ServiceNow University. This GitHub repo allows the content to live on.
